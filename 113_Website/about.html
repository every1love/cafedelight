        <h1>About Pasig Catholic College</h1>
        <p>Pasig Catholic College as an institution of character and competence for over one hundred years of existence is still committed to evangelize the young people in all seasons in bringing the Good News who is no other than Jesus Christ through Catholic education. The challenge of the New Evangelization is humongous and complex as such is synonymous to proclamation of the good news. PCC never gets tired of reiterating and upholding the good news to all, despite the pandemic situation. The good news must always be the truth – Jesus, the risen Lord. Listening, Discerning and Living are the movements for PCC’s 109th founding anniversary. PCC hopes to cascade these movements to all stakeholders as these lead us to holiness.</p>
        <p>PCC is under the new leadership of Bp. Vergara as the Acting College President, and Fr. Daniel L. Estacio as the Assistant to the President. Fr. Estacio is the former parish priest of Sto. Niño de Taguig Parish from 2015 to 2021. The bishop’s leadership values are empowerment, coordination and communication. These principles are highly significant in stirring the institution to greater heights amid the pandemic. Strengthening of PCC’s mission, exploring bold initiatives on curricular innovations, and strategic partnerships are key priorities of Bp. Vergara’s administration.</p>
        <p>PCC’s roots stemmed from the noble heritage of its founding CICM missionaries. After more than a century, the journey towards excellence, service, spirituality, social transformation and most significantly, quality Catholic education, moves… and goes on, as envisioned by its founder, Rev. Fr. Pierre Cornelis de Brouwer, CICM, moves on as PCC reviews its past, faces the present, and conquers its future.</p>
